# 🖼️ Neural Style Transfer Web App

This is a full-stack web application that performs **Neural Style Transfer** — a deep learning technique that blends a content image with a style image to produce a unique, artistic result. Users can either choose from a collection of **preloaded artistic styles** or upload their own style image.

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID",
  databaseURL: "https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseio.com"
};

import { initializeApp } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.22.0/firebase-app.js";
import { getDatabase } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.22.0/firebase-database.js";

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const database = getDatabase(app);
